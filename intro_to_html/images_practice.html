    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of
        papers. Many students define paragraphs
        in terms of length: a paragraph is a
        group of at least five sentences, a
        paragraph is half a page long, etc.
        In reality, though, the unity and
        coherence of ideas among sentences is what
        constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
        defined as “a group of sentences or a
        <strong>single sentence that forms a unit.”</strong>
