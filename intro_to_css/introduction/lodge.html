            <p class="important first-paragraph">Make the <em>Great Lakescape Lodge</em> your destination in beautiful
                Door County. Nestled on the shores of Lake
                Michigan at Bailey's Harbor, our lodge is close to everything that
                Door County has to offer.</p>
            <p class="less-important">We are a family-owned and operated establishment and have been
                part of the Northern Wisconsin vacation scene for
                25 years. The lodge is a great place for a romantic getaway or a
                family reunion. We also cater weddings and can
                provide all of the amenities to make your time here a special one.</p>
